## Section 2: Human Resources Policies

### Policy: Remote Work
All full-time employees are eligible for a hybrid remote work schedule, which must be approved by their direct manager. Employees are expected to be available online during core business hours, from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. The company provides a standard equipment package, including a laptop, one monitor, and a keyboard. For any additional equipment, employees can use their annual $250 tech stipend. All remote work must be conducted within the country of employment due to tax regulations.

### Policy: Time Off (PTO)
Employees receive 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) per year, which accrues monthly. In addition to PTO, there are 10 paid company-wide holidays. Unused PTO, up to a maximum of 5 days, can be rolled over to the next calendar year. Sick leave is handled separately and does not count against PTO.

## Section 3: Financial Policies

### Policy: Expenses
Employees can expense work-related purchases up to $75 without prior approval. For any single expense exceeding $75, a manager's email approval is required *before* the purchase is made. All expenses must be submitted through the 'Expensify' portal within 30 days of the purchase date to be eligible for reimbursement. Air travel must be booked in Economy class unless the flight is longer than 8 hours.

## Section 4: IT Department Best Practices

### Convention: Server Naming
To maintain order and clarity in our infrastructure, all servers must follow a strict naming convention:
- Production web servers: 'web-prod-XX' (e.g., web-prod-01)
- Staging web servers: 'web-stg-XX' (e.g., web-stg-01)
- Production database servers: 'db-prod-XX' (e.g., db-prod-01)
- Staging database servers: 'db-stg-XX' (e.g., db-stg-01)
- Specialized service servers (e.g., caching, jobs): 'svc-[service_name]-XX' (e.g., svc-redis-01)

### Procedure: User Account Security
All user accounts must have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled. Passwords must be changed every 90 days and must not be reused. If an employee suspects their account has been compromised, they must immediately report it to the IT helpdesk.
